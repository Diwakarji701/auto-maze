## Introduction

This project presents a maze game where you must navigate through a maze by finding the path from the starting point to the exit. The maze is generated randomly, and the backtracking algorithm is used to find a solution.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the game up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame (You can install it using `pip`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-game-backtracking.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd maze-game-backtracking
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move your character through the maze.
- Your goal is to reach the exit represented by a specific tile in the maze.
- The maze is randomly generated, and the backtracking algorithm is used to ensure there's a solution.
- Enjoy the game and have fun solving mazes!

## Algorithm

The backtracking algorithm works as follows:

1. Start at the initial position.
2. Move in a direction (up, down, left, or right) as far as possible until you hit a wall or reach the exit.
3. If you reach a dead-end (no further moves are possible), backtrack to the previous position.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach the exit.

The algorithm is implemented in the code, and you can see it in action while playing the game.
